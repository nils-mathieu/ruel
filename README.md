The Ruel Operating System.

# Name

The name Ruel is a temporary code name for the project. It is the name of [Ruel Stroud], a
fictional character from [Wakfu], a French animated series. I like the character and find the
name funny. That's it.

# Goals

This toy operating system project is mostly a learning experience for me. I want to discover
new things, learn how an operating system works, what it does. I also want to have fun.

During my initial research, I found some resources talking about exokernels, which I found
very interesting. I want to explore this concept and see if I can implement the idea in this
project. I might just end up writing yet another microkernel, though :P.

For now, the goal is to focus on the x86_64 architecture. I might attempt to port the project
to ARM later on, but I don't want to get ahead of myself. One instruction set is enough
for now.

# Dependencies

I want to keep the dependencies to a minimum. For two reasons: I want to learn how to do
everything, and avoid relying on other people's code to do the job for me. I also want to
keep the code as simple as possible, and avoid building abstraction layers on top of others
abstraction layers.

# Resources

Surprisingly, there are a *lot* of resources online about operating systems. Here are the one I'm
using often:

- The [OSDev Wiki][wiki] is a great starting point. It has a lot of information about the different
  aspects of operating systems (though maybe a bit too 32-bit centric). It does not replace the
  Intel manuals, but it's generally a good complement when you already know what you want to do
  but need to a refresher on the structures you're working with.

- The [IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals][manual] are the official
  documentation for the Intel x86 and x86-64 architectures. They are very detailed and
  comprehensive. They are also very dry and technical. I don't recommend reading them from
  start to finish, but they are a great reference when you need to know how something works
  precisely.

- The [Exokernel whitepaper][whitepaper] is a great read. It's a bit old and I didn't really find
  any more (newer) resources on the subject, but it's a great introduction to the concept of
  exokernels.

# Trying it at home

## Building

This project uses the latest nightly version of Rust. If you don't have it installed, invoking
the commands described below will automatically install the correct version of Rust for you.

```sh
cargo build --release --target x86_64.json --package ruel
```

This crates a build artifact in `target/x86_64/release/ruel` (if you didn't change the target
directory of Cargo). That is the kernel image.

## Running

Currently, the project depends on the [Limine bootloader] to start. This is the only way
to boot the kernel for now. I might add support for other bootloaders later on, such as
grub through multiboot2.

The easiest way to run the kernel is to use an emulator such as [QEMU]. You can use the
following commands to run the kernel:

[Limine bootloader]: https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine
[QEMU]: https://www.qemu.org/

```sh
# Clone the Limine repository
git clone https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine.git?

# Build the kernel
cargo build --release --target x86_64.json --package ruel

# Create a directory for the ISO image
mkdir iso_root

# Copy the kernel image to the ISO image directory
cp target/x86_64/release/ruel iso_root/ruel

# Create a configuration file for Limine
cat << EOF > iso_root/limine.cfg
:Ruel
    PROTOCOL=limine
    KERNEL_PATH=boot:///ruel
    MODULE_PATH=boot:///
EOF


# Create an ISO image with the kernel and the Limine bootloader
xorriso -as mkisofs -b limine/limine-bios-cd.bin \
        -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
        --efi-boot limine/limine-uefi-cd.bin \
        -efi-boot-part --efi-boot-image --protective-msdos-label \
        iso_root -o image.iso

# Installs the Limine bootloader on the ISO image
./limine/limine bios-install image.iso

# Run the ISO image in QEMU
qemu-system-x86_64 -M q35 -m 2G -cdrom image.iso -boot d \
    -serial stdio -no-reboot
```

## Configuration

Upon boot, the kernel will run the an init process with all capabilities. This process will be
responsible for starting the user's environment. For more information about to write an
init process, see [`docs/init.md`].
